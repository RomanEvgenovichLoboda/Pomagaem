        <h4>Orphanages in Ukraine: how to help?</h4>
        <ul>
        <h1>Initially, the fund focused on orphanages in Ukraine and assistance in hospitals. Actively working with foster families who took orphans and toddlers under their protection, whose parents were deprived of this high-profile title by the state, the fund's employees predetermined one of the main areas of work. At the same time, volunteers made a huge contribution to the formation and development of the fund, people who, at the behest of their hearts, work in the most difficult places - hospitals where seriously ill children are in desperate need of any help. And so it happened that the work with orphans, the search for foster families and assistance in medical institutions determines the policy of the fund.</h1> 

           <h1> It's no secret that orphanages in Ukraine are not empty and the children there are not very happy. No matter how good the orphanage is, every child in it dreams of parents, a full-fledged family, their own personal belongings and a separate room. About those moments that children in traditional families do not even notice in the general hustle and bustle of the day. That is why the "Helping" Foundation has developed a certain principle of helping children's homes. The main thing is not only to make life in the boarding school comfortable and carefree by all means, it is much more important that the orphans of Ukraine find new parents. Then the life of children will completely change for the better.</h1> 

           <h1>One can dream that one day Ukraine will close orphanages, because there will be no children left who need it - all orphans will be sorted out by foster families. It would be great! But there is the most urgent problem of orphanhood, we must work with it in the first place. The Foundation is doing a great job in various areas: </h1>
            <li>
                <a>
                    With foster families, working with both children and parents. Help everyone to adapt to the new situation, provide psychological support to cope with the new situation and avoid possible problems of settling down.

                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a>
                    With orphans, providing them with various assistance, both financial and supporting in difficult times, giving attention and care, holding various fun activities. In addition, it is important to give orphans legal knowledge, to explain their opportunities and privileges.

                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a>
                    With dysfunctional families, watching the lives of children and explaining to negligent parents how important the concept of the family is and how easy it is to lose, but difficult to restore.

                </a>
            </li>
            <h1>
                Everyone should remember that there are no other people's old people, children, they are all ours! And it is in our power to help the most vulnerable sections of society, to give them strength. Anyone can come to the orphanage in Dnipro, see what exactly the children need and try to help them.</h1>
